CMPSC 465 Assignment 2

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- **Algorithms in pseudo code MUST be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either cpp or java as the syntax highlight. **
- **Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)**
- **Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)**
- **Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)**
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.  

## Problem Set

### Problem 1 

Consider a variation of sequential search that scans a list to return the number of occurrences of a given search key in the list. Does its efficiency differ from the efficiency of classic sequential search?

#### Answer:

The efficiency differs between the variation of a sequential search and classic sequential search. The classic sequential search makes at best '1' comparison and at worst 'n' comparisons. However, the modified sequential search always makes 'n' comparisons since it has to iterate through all the values.

### Problem 2

The range of a finite nonempty set of $n$ real numbers $S$ is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest elements of $S$. For each representation of $S$ given below, describe an algorithm in pseudo code to compute the range. Indicate the time efficiency classes of these algorithms using Big-$O$. 

1. An unsorted array
2. A sorted array
3. A sorted singly linked list
4. A binary search tree

**Answer:**

1. T(n) = 2T(n-1) = O(n)

```c++
Algorithm Range(A[0..n-1])
    //Computes range between a max and min value
    //Input:  An unsorted array A[0..n-1] real numbers 
    //Output: Range between max and min value
    int max <- A[0]
    int min <- A[0]
    for i <- to A[0..n-1].size() do
        if A[i] > max
            max <- A[i]
        else if A[i] < min
            min <- A[i]
    return (max-min)
```

2. T(n) = O(1)

   ```c++
   Algorithm Range(A[0..n-1])
       //Computes range between a max and min value
       //Input:  A sorted array A[0..n-1] real numbers
       //Output: Range between max and min value
       return (A[n-1] - A[0])
   ```

3. T(n) = O(n)

   ```c++
   Algorithm Range(node *head)
       //Computes range between a max and min value
       //Input:  Sorted linked list real numbers
       //Output: Range between max and min value
       int min <- head
       int max;
       while head != null do
           if head -> next == null
               max <- head
               head <- (head -> next)
       return (max-min)
   ```

4. T(n) = O(n)

   ```c++
   Algorithm Range(tree *t)
       //Compute range between a max and min value
       //Input: A tree made of real numbers
       //Output: Range between max and min value
       tree *min
       tree *max
       if (t == null) return (null)
       min <- t
       max <- t
       while min -> left != null do
           min <- (min -> left)
       while max -> right != null do
           max <- (max -> right)
       return (*max - *min)
   ```

### Problem 3

Compute the following sums (you need to provide detailed steps) :

1. $1+3+5+7+\dots+999$
   
2. $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (i+j)$

**Answer:**

1. $$
   (0) = 1 \\
   (1) = 3 \\
   (2) = 5 \\
   ... \\
   (n) = 2i +1 \\
   \Big[\sum_{i=0}^{499} (2i +1)] = \sum (2i) + \sum 1 = 2\sum(i) + (499 - 0 + 1 ) = 2\frac{499(499+1)}{2} + 500 = 250000
   $$

2. $$
   \sum(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}(i)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}(j)) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(i^2 + \frac{1}{2}(i(i-1))) = 
   \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(\frac{i}{2}(3i-1)) = \frac{n}{2}(n-1)^2
   $$

### Problem 4

Consider the following algorithm:

```c++
Algorithm Mystery(n) {
  // Input:A nonnegative integer n
  S = 0;
  for i = 1 to n do {
    S = S + i * i;
  }
  return S
}
```

**Answer:**

1. Sums the squares of real numbers.
2. basic operation: * 
3. input size n
4. $ T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n$ 
5. Cannot be improved . Alternative is $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$  -> $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n^3}{3} = T(n) = O(n^3) $

------

### Problem 5

Consider the following algorithm:

```java
ALGORITHM Secret(A[0..n − 1]) {
  //Input: An array A[0..n − 1] of n real numbers
  minval = A[0]; 
  maxval = A[0];
  for i = 1 to n - 1 do {
    if A[i]< minval {
      minval = A[i]
    }
    if A[i]> maxval {
      maxval = A[i]
    }
  }
  return maxval − minval;
}
```

1. What does this algorithm compute?
2. What is its basic operation?
3. How many times is the basic operation executed?
4. What is the efficiency class of this algorithm?
5. Suggest an improvement, or a better algorithm altogether, and indicate its efficiency class. If you cannot do it, try to prove that, in fact, it cannot be done.

**Answer:**

1.  Calculates the range between maximum and minimum n real numbers in the array.
2.  '<' comparison operation
3.  2n-2 times
4.  O(n)
5.  Algorithm improvement cannot be done.  The recursive divide and conquer algorithm has an O(n) efficiency.

------

### Problem 6

Consider the following recursive algorithm for computing the sum of the first $n$ cubes: $S(n) = 1^3+2^3+\dots+n^3$.

```java
ALGORITHM S(n) {
  //Input: A positive integer n
  //Output: The sum of the first n cubes
  if n == 1 return 1;
  else return S(n - 1) + n * n * n;
}
```

1. Set up and solve a recurrence relation for the number of times the algorithm’s basic operation is executed.
2. How does this algorithm compare with the straightforward non-recursive algorithm for computing this sum?

**Answer:**

1. $T(n) = T(n-1) + 3 $
	$T(1) = 1 $
	$T(n) = T(n-2) + 3 + 3 $ 
	$T(n) = T(n-3) + 3 + 3 + 3$ 
	... $T(n-i) + 3i,$ $Let$  $n-i =1$ & $i = n$ 
	$T(1) + 3n = 1 +5n = 5n \epsilon O(n)$
	
2.  Both have $\epsilon O(n)$ efficiency

------

### Problem 7

Consider the following recursive algorithm

```cpp
ALGORITHM Q(n) {
  //Input: A positive integer n
  if n == 1 return 1;
  else return Q(n - 1) + 2 * n - 1;
}
```

1. Set up a recurrence relation for this function’s values and solve it to determine what this algorithm computes.
2. Set up a recurrence relation for the number of multiplications made by this algorithm and solve it.

**Answer:**

1. $ T(n) = T(n-1) +2n -1 $ 

   $T(1) = 1$

   $ T(n) =  T(n-2) +2(n+n-1) -2$

   $T(n) = T(n-3) + 2(n +n-1 +n-2) - 3$

   ...  $T(n) = T(1) + 2i -1 = 2i$

   $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}2i = \frac{2n(n+1)}{2} = n^2$

2. $T(n-1) + 1 = n-1$

------

### Problem 8

Consider the following recursive algorithm.

```cpp
ALGORITHM Riddle(A[0..n − 1]) {
  //Input: An array A[0..n − 1] of real numbers
  if n == 1 return A[0];
  else {
    temp = Riddle(A[0..n − 2]);
    if temp ≤ A[n − 1] return temp;
    else return A[n − 1];
  }
}
```

1. What does this algorithm compute?
2. Set up a recurrence relation for the algorithm’s basic operation count and solve it.

**Answer:**

1. Computes lowest element in the array.

2. $T(n) = T(n-1)+1$

   $= T(n-2) + 1 + 1$ 

   $= T(n-i)+ i= T(1) + n = 0+n = n$

------

### Problem 9

Consider the following algorithm to check whether a graph defined by its adjacency matrix is complete.

```cpp
ALGORITHM GraphComplete(A[0..n − 1, 0..n − 1]) {
  //Input: Adjacency matrix A[0..n − 1, 0..n − 1]) of an undirected graph G
  //Output: 1 (true) if G is complete and 0 (false) otherwise
  if n == 1 return 1; //one-vertex graph is complete by definition
  else {
    if not GraphComplete(A[0..n − 2, 0..n − 2]) return 0;
    else {
      for j = 0 to n - 2 do {
        if A[n − 1, j] == 0 return 0;
      }
      return 1;
    }
  }
}
```

What is the algorithm’s efficiency class in the worst case?

**Answer:**

$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i + 1= \frac{n^2}{2}+n-> O(n^2)$
