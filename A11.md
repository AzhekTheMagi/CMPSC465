# CMPSC 465 Assignment - Algorithm Limitations

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either `cpp` or `java` as the syntax highlight. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://csrgxtu.github.io/2015/03/20/Writing-Mathematic-Fomulars-in-Markdown/ 
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

A certain problem can be solved by an algorithm whose running time is in $O(n^{log_2 n})$, is this problem tractable?

#### Answer:

The problem is intractable.  $O(n^{log_2 n})$ grows faster than polynomial time, i.e., computing time is greater than polynomial time.

### Problem 2

Design a polynomial-time algorithm for the graph 2-coloring problem: determine whether vertices of a given graph can be colored in no more than two colors so that no two adjacent vertices are colored the same color. Describe your algorithm in English step by step.

#### Answer:

tep 1: Perform a DFS traversal of the graph.
step 2a: If DFS finds no back edges, alternate between two color scheme for vertices on every level. For example, level one vertices are colored white, while level two vertices are colored black.
step 2b: If DFS finds a back edge, check to see that every back edge connects vertices to applicable level. If true, color.

### Problem 3

Outline a polynomial-time algorithm that verifies whether or not a proposed solution solves the problem. Describe your algorithm in English step by step and explain why it is in polynomial time.

1. knapsack problem
2. bin packing problem

#### Answer:

1.  step 1: Sum up weights of items in knapsack. 
    step 2: Sum up values of items in knapsack. 
    step 3: Verify that weight sum is less than knapsack capacity.
    step 4: Check to see that value sum is larger than a given value or largest sum possible
    Summation complexity takes polynomial time.

2. step 1: Check that the number of bins does not exceed a given value.
    step 2: Sum the sizes of the items assigned for each respective bin.
    step 3: Verify summed size does not exceed capacity for assigned bin.
    Summation complexity takes polynomial time.
