# CMPSC 465 Assignment 5

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either the `cpp` or `java` syntax highlighter. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

a. Write pseudocode for a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the position of the largest element in an array of `n` numbers.

b. What will be your algorithm's output for arrays with several elements of the largest value?

c. Set up and solve a recurrence relation for the number of key comparisons made by your algorithm.

d. How does this algorithm compare with the brute-force algorithm for this problem?

#### Answer:

a.
```c++
Algorithm MaxElement(A[l..r])
//Finds largest element in an array of numbers
//Input: Subarray of array A[0..n-1], defined by its left and right indices
//l and r
//Output: Index of largest element
if l = r
    return 1
else
    mid <- floor((l + r) / 2)
    i <- MaxElement(A[l..mid])
    j <- MaxElement(A[(mid + 1)..r])
    if A[i] >= A[j]
        return i
    else
        return j
```
b. Algorithm outputs leftmost largest element index.
c. 
$ T(n)= 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + 1, $ $ T(1)=0$
let $n=2^k$
$ T(2^k)=2T(2^{k-1})+ 1 $
$ =2*2T(2^{k-2}) + 1 + 1 $
$ ... = 2^iT(2^{k-i}) + i$
let $k-i=1$
$ 2^iT(1) + i = i $
let $ i = k-1 $ & $k=n$
$ T(n)=n-1 $
d. Both algorithms require the same number of comparisons. However, the Brute force algorithm uses an iterative approach and avoids the overhead recursive calls.

### Problem 2

Design an algorithm in pseudocode  to rearrange elements of a given array of n real numbers so that all its negative elements precede all its positive elements. Your algorithm should be both time efficient and space efficient.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm NegPrecedePos(A[0..n-1])
//Puts negative elements before positive elements
//Input: Array A[0..n-1] of real numbers
//Output: Array sorted with negative elements before positive elements
i <- 0
j <- n - 1
while i < j do
    if A[i] < 0
        i <- i + 1
    else
        temp <- A[i]
        A[i] <- A[j]
        A[j] <- temp
        j <- j - 1
```

### Problem 3

Design a divide-and-conquer algorithm in pseudocode for computing the number of levels in a binary tree. (In particular, the algorithm must return 0 and 1 for the empty and single-node trees, respectively.) What is the time efficiency class of your algorithm? The tree node class is as follows:

```c++
class Node {
  int val;
  Node* leftchild;
  Node* rightchild;
}
```

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Height(T)
//Computes number of levels in a binary tree
//Input: Binary tree
//Output: Number of levels in T
if T == 0
    return 0
else
    return max(Height(T->leftchild), Height(T->rightchild)) + 1
```
Efficiency: $ \theta(n)$

------

### Problem 4

The following algorithm seeks to compute the number of leaves in a binary tree.

```c++
Algorithm LeafCounter(T) {
  //Computes recursively the number of leaves in a binary tree
  //Input: A binary tree T
  //Output: The number of leaves in T
  if T == NULL {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return LeafCounter(T->left)+ LeafCounter(T->right);
  }
}
```

Is this algorithm correct? If it is, prove it; if it is not, make an appropriate correction.

#### Answer:
Incorrect: Original algorithm returns 0 but it needs to return 1
Corrected Algorithm:
```c++
Algorithm LeafCounter(T)
//Computes recursively the number of leaves in a binary tree
//Input: A binary tree T
//Output: The number of leaves in T
if T == NULL
    return 0
else if T->left == 0 && T->right == 0
    return 1
else
    return LeafCounter(T->left)+ LeafCounter(T->right)
```

### Problem 5

Draw a binary tree with 10 nodes labeled 0, 1, . . . , 9 in such a way that the inorder and postorder traversals of the tree yield the following lists: 9, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2, 7, 6, 8, 5 (inorder) and 9, 1, 4, 0, 3, 6, 7, 5, 8, 2 (postorder).

#### Answer:
            2
       /         \
      3           8
     / \         / \
    9   0       7   5
       / \       \
      1   4       6

### Problem 7

For the one-dimensional version of the closest-pair problem, i.e., for the problem of finding two closest numbers among a given set of n real numbers, design an algorithm in pseudocode that is directly based on the divide-and-conquer technique and determine its efficiency class. Is it a good algorithm for this problem?

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm ClosestPair(A[l..r])
//Solves a one-dimensional closest-pair problem
//Input: Subarray of array A[0..n-1], defined by its left and right indices
//l and r sorted in nondecreasing order
//Output: Euclidean distance between the closest pair of points
if r - l == 1
    return (A[r] - A[l])
else
    mid <- floor((l + r) / 2)
    i <- ClosestPair(A[l..mid])
    j <- ClosestPair(A[(mid + 1)..r])
    d <- A[mid +1] - A[mid]
    return min(i, j, d)
```
Efficiency class: $ \theta(nlogn) $
I would say not an appropriate algorithm for this problem. The implementation of this algorithm is more complicated compared to say
comparing the distance between adjacent elements.
