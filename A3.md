# CMPSC 465 Assignment 3

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either `cpp` or `java` as the syntax highlight. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

 A network topology specifies how computers, printers, and other devices are connected over a network. The figure below illustrates three common topologies of networks: the ring, the star, and the fully connected mesh.

You are given a boolean matrix A[0..n − 1, 0..n − 1], where n > 3, which is supposed to be the adjacency matrix of a graph modeling a network with one of these topologies. Your task is to determine which of these three topologies, if any, the matrix represents. Design a brute-force algorithm for this task and
indicate its time efficiency class.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Vertex(A[0..n-1, 0..n-1])
    //Computes topology of boolean matrix using a Brute Force method
    //Input: Boolean matrix A[0..n-1, 0..n-1]
    //Output: One of three topologies (star, ring, or fully connected mesh)
    degree1 <- 0
    degree2 <- 0
    for i <- 0 to n-1 do
        for j <- 0 to n-1 do
            degree1 <- degree1 + A[i,j]
            degree2 <- degree2 + A[i+1, j]
    if degree1 == 1
        return star
    if degree2 == 2
        return ring
    if degree1 == degree2
        return connected mesh
```

Efficiency Class: $ O(n^2) $

### Problem 2

Determine the number of character comparisons made by the brute-force algorithm in searching for the pattern `GANDHI` in the text
`THERE_IS_MORE_TO_LIFE_THAN_INCREASING_ITS_SPEED`
Assume that the length of the text, it is 47 characters long, is known before the search starts.

#### Answer:

43

### Problem 3

Consider the problem of counting, in a given text, the number of substrings that start with an `A` and end with a `B`. For example, there are four such substrings in `CABAAXBYA`. Design a brute-force algorithm for this problem and determine its efficiency class [in pseudo code!].

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Substring(A[0..n-1])
    //Counts number of substrings that start with an 'A' and end with a 'B'
    //Input: Character text array
    //Output: Number of substrings in character text array
    j <- 0
    counter <- 0
    for i <- 0 to n-1 do
        for j <- i + 1 to n-1 do
            if A[i] == 'A' && A[j] == 'B'
                counter++
    return counter
```

Efficiency Class = $ O(n^2) $

### Problem 4

Assuming that each tour can be generated in constant time, what will be the efficiency class of the exhaustive-search algorithm outlined in the text for the traveling salesman problem? Explain your answer.

#### Answer:

Every tour permutation and n times the total number of tours must be calculated, which makes the efficiency class $ O(n!) $. 

---

### Problem 5

Consider the clique problem: given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, determine whether the graph contains a clique of size $k$, i.e., a complete subgraph of $k$ vertices. Design an exhaustive-search algorithm in pseudo code for this problem.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Clique(G[0..n-1, k])
    //Determines if graph contains a clique of size k
    //Input: Graph G and a positive integer k
    //Output: True value if clique is found or false if not.
    j <- 0
    for i <- 0 to n-1 do
        for j <- i + 1 to n-1 do
            if G[i,j] != 1
                return false
    return true
```

### Problem 6:

Consider the following graph:

![](graph_1.png)

1. Write down the adjacency matrix and adjacency lists specifying this graph. (Assume that the matrix rows and columns and vertices in the adjacency lists follow in the alphabetical order of the vertex labels.)
2. Starting at vertex `a` and resolving ties by the vertex alphabetical order, traverse the graph by depth-first search and construct the corresponding depth-first search tree. Give the order in which the vertices were reached for the first time (pushed onto the traversal stack) and the order in which the vertices became dead ends (popped off the stack).

#### Answer:

1.

Adjacency List:

```
a -> b -> c -> d -> e 
b -> a -> d -> f
c -> a -> g
d -> a -> b -> f
e -> a -> g
f -> b -> d
g -> c -> e
```



Adjacency Matrix:

|      | a    | b    | c    | d    | e    | f    | g    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a    | 0    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 0    | 0    |
| b    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    | 0    |
| c    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    |
| d    | 1    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    |
| e    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    |
| f    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 0    |
| g    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0    |

       b   c      
      /     \

### Problem 7

If we define sparse graphs as graphs for which $|E| \in O(|V|)$, which implementation of DFS will have a better time efficiency for such graphs, the one that uses the adjacency matrix or the one that uses the adjacency lists?

#### Answer

Adjacency lists have better time efficiency for sparse graphs due to a time efficiency of $ \theta (|V|+|E|) $ 

---

### Problem 8

Let `G` be a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges.

- True or false: All its DFS forests (for traversals starting at different vertices) will have the same number of trees? 
- True or false: All its DFS forests will have the same number of tree edges and the same number of back edges?

Explain your answer

#### Answer

- False: DFS forests may have differing numbers of trees, depending on vertex start position. 
- False: DFS forests may have differing edges based on graph topology.

### Problem 9

Traverse the graph of `Problem 6` by breadth-first search and construct the corresponding breadth-first search tree. Start the traversal at vertex `a` and resolve ties by the vertex alphabetical order.

#### Answer

```
       a
   /  |   |  \ 
  b   c   d   e
 /    |   
f     g
```

### Problem 10

Explain how one can identify connected components of a graph by using

1. a depth-first search. 
2. a breadth-first search.

#### Answer

1. Mark each vertex with zero as a mark of being "unvisited". Call dfs(v) for unmarked vertices. If vertex unvisited, recursively call dfs.
2. Mark each vertex with zero as a mark of being "unvisited". If vertex marked as "unvisited" call bfs(v). bfs function loops through labeling all vertices.

### Problem 11

Write an algorithm in pseudo code that, for a given graph, outputs vertices of each connected component.

#### Answer

```c++
Algorithm DFS(G)
    //Outputs vertices of each connected component
    //Input: Undirected or directed Graph
    //Output: Vertices of each connected component
    Mark each vertex in v with 0 as a mark of being "unvisited"
    count <- 0
    for each vertex v in V do 
        if v == 0
            dfs(v)
Algorithm dfs(v)
    count <- count + 1
    v <- count
    print v
    for each vertex w in V adjacent to v do
        if w == 0
            dfs(w)
```



---

### Problem 12

Write an algorithm in pseudo code that, for a given graph, outputs its cycle or a message that the graph is acyclic.

#### Answer

```c++
Algorithm DFS_Cycle(G)
    //Determines if given graph is cycle or acyclic
    //Input: Graph
    //Output: A message stating whether graph is cycle or acyclic.
    Mark each vertex in v with 1 as a mark of being "visited"
    Mark p as the parent node in each vertex v
    cycle <- False
    for each vertex w in V adjacent to v do
        if w == 0
            DFS_Cycle(w,v)
        else if w != p
            cycle <- True
    print <- cycle //True value prints Cycle graph, while False value prints Acyclic graph.
    
```
