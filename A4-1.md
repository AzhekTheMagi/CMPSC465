# CMPSC 465 Assignment 4

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either `cpp` or `java` as the syntax highlight. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using the Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

Consider the following algorithm to check connectivity of a graph defined by its adjacency matrix.

```c++
Algorithm Connected(A[0..n-1, 0..n-1]) {
  //Input: Adjacency matrix A of an undirected graph G
  //Output: 1 (true) if G is connected and 0 (false) if it is not
  if n == 1 return 1; // //one-vertex graph is connected by definition
  else {
    if not Connected(A[0..n-2, 0..n-2]) return 0;
    else {
      for j = 0 to n - 2 do {
        if A[n-1, j] return 1;
      }
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
```

Does this algorithm work correctly for every undirected graph with `n` vertices? If you answer YES, indicate the algorithm's efficiency class in the worst case. If you answer NO, provide a counter example. 

#### Answer:

Algorithm does not work for every undirected graph. Graphs with edges not connecting between nodes and connecting only to the root cause incorrect output at 'if not Connected(A[0..n-2, 0..n-2]) return 0'.

### Problem 2

Prove that the topological sorting problem has a solution if and only if it is a DAG.

#### Answer:

In a DAG, there is always at least one node that has no incoming edges. Topological sorting relies on this since vertices can be linearly ordered so that for every edge its starting vertex is listed before its ending vertex.

------

### Problem 3

For a digraph with `n` vertices, what is the largest number of distinct solutions the topological sorting problem can have?

#### Answer:

$ n! $

------

### Problem 4

Can one use the order in which vertices are pushed onto the DFS stack (instead of the order they are popped off it) to solve the topological sorting problem? Justify your answer.

#### Answer:

No, reference exercise-Topological Sorting example from chp4 power point. The DFS traversal starts at 'a' and pushes the rest in the following order 'abegcfd'. Neither this 'abegcfd' sequence nor reversing said sequence solves the topological sorting problem.

### Problem 5

Generate all permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} by the bottom-up minimal-change algorithm. Show the steps.

------

### Problem 6

Generate all permutations of {3, 8, 2} by the Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Show the steps.

#### Answer:

$ \overleftarrow{3} $ $ \overleftarrow{8} $ $ \overleftarrow{2} $

$ \overleftarrow{8} $ $ \overleftarrow{3}  $ $  \overleftarrow{2} $

$\overrightarrow{8}$ $ \overleftarrow{2} $ $\overleftarrow{3}$

$\overleftarrow{2} $ $ \overrightarrow{8} $ $\overleftarrow{3}$

$\overleftarrow{2}$ $\overleftarrow{3} $ $  \overrightarrow{8}  $

$\overleftarrow{3} $ $\overleftarrow{2}$ $ \overleftarrow{8}$

------

### Problem 7

Write **pseudo code** for a recursive algorithm for generating all $2^n$ bit strings of length n.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm F(k)
//Process all 2^n bit strings of length n
//Input: Positive n integer
//Output: Bit strings of length n as contents of A[0..n-1]
if n == 0
    print A
else
    A[n-1] <- 0
    F(n-1)
    B[n-1] <- 1
    F(n-1)
```

### Problem 8

Apply quickselect to find the median of the list of numbers 9, 12, 5, 17, 20, 30, 8. Show the steps.

#### Answer:

$n=7$, $k=\lceil7/2\rceil=4$,  $k-1=3$

| 0    | 1        | 2    | 3        | 4    | 5        | 6    |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- |
| 9    | 12       | 5    | [**17**] | 20   | 30       | 8    |
| 9    | [**12**] | 5    | 8        | 17   | 30       | 20   |
| 9    | 5        | 8    | [**12**] | 17   | 30       | 20   |
| 5    | 9        | 8    | [**12**] | 17   | 30       | 20   |
| 5    | 8        | 9    | 12       | 17   | [**30**] | 20   |
| 5    | 8        | 9    | 12       | 17   | 30       | 20   |

$s=k-1=4-1=3$

median = A[3]=12

------

### Problem 9 

Outline an algorithm in **pseudo code** for finding the largest key in a binary search tree. Would you classify your algorithm as a variable-size-decrease algorithm? What is the time efficiency class of your algorithm in the worst case?

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm MaxKey(n)
//Finds largest key in a binary search tree
//Input: Binary tree
//Output: Largest key contained in element
while x.right != NULL
    x <- x.right
return x
```

worst case: C(n) = n 

------

### Problem 10

An array A[0..n - 2] contains `n-1` integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order. (Thus one integer in this range is missing.) Design an algorithm in $\Theta(\log n)$ to find the missing integer. Your algorithm should be given in **pseudo code**.  For example, the array `A` could be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` in which `5` is missing. 

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Find(A[0..n-2])
//Finds missing number in array
//Input: Array of real numbers
//Output: Missing array number
x <- 0
y <- A[0..n-2].size
while (y - x ) > 1 do
    Array midpoint <- (x + y) / 2
    if (A[x] - x) != (A[midpoint] - midpoint)
        y <- midpoint
    else if (A[y] - y) != (A[midpoint] - midpoint)
        x <- midpoint
return (A[midpoint] + 1)
```
