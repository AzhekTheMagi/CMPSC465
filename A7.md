# CMPSC 465 Assignment 7

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either the `cpp` or `java` syntax highlighter. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial:  http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

The ancestry problem asks to determine whether a vertex `u` is an ancestor of vertex `v` in a given binary (or, more generally, rooted ordered) tree of `n` vertices. Design a $O(n)$ input-enhancement algorithm that provides sufficient information to solve this problem for any pair of the tree’s vertices in constant time.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm Ancestry(T, u, v)
    //Determines if u is an ancestor of v
    //Input: Rooted tree of two vertices
    //Output: Returns true if u is an ancestor of v, false otherwise
    Do preorder travesal of binary tree
    Do postorder traversal of binary tree
    If preorder(u) <= preorder(v) and postorder(u) >= postoder(v)
        return true
    else
        return false
```

### Problem 2

Apply Horspool’s algorithm to search for the pattern `BAOBAB` in the text: `BESS_KNEW_ABOUT_BAOBABS`. You need to 1) setup a shift table, and 2) trace the algorithm. 

#### Answer:

### Problem 3

For searching in a text of length 12 for a pattern of length 5 with Horspool’s algorithm, give an example of 1) a worst-case example, and 2) a best-case example. For a complete example, you need to provide both the text and the pattern. 

#### Answer:

Worst case: At least one pattern matches 

Best case: No matching patterns

### Problem 4

For the input 30, 20, 56, 75, 31, 19 and hash function $h(K) = K \mod 11$. 

1) construct the open hash table.

2) find the largest number of key comparisons in a successful search in this table.

3) find the average number of key comparisons in a successful search in this table.

#### Answer:

1) ![](E:\OneDrive\Skool\PSU\year3\summer\CMPSC465\module10\q4.png)

2) Largest amount of key comparisons is 3 when looking for key 31.

3)
$$
\frac{1}{6} +2*\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+3*\frac{1}{6}+2*\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6} =\frac{10}{6}\simeq1.67
$$

### Problem 5

Find the probability of all $n$ keys being hashed to the same cell of a hash table of size $m$ if the hash function distributes keys evenly among all the cells of the table.

#### Answer:

$$
(\frac{1}{m})^n= (\frac{1}{m})^{n-1}
$$

### Problem 6

Explain how to use hashing to check whether all elements of a list are distinct. What is the time efficiency of this application? Compare its efficiency with that of the brute-force algorithm (Section 2.3) and of the presorting-based algorithm (Section 6.1).

#### Answer:

Insert elements in a hash table until an element with a matching key is found or list finishes. Time efficiency $ \theta(n) $. Hashing is faster than brute-force $ \theta(n^2) $ and presorting $ \theta(nlogn) $.

### Problem 7

Fill in the following table with the average-case (as the first entry) and worst case (as the second entry) efficiency classes for the five implementations of the ADT dictionary:

|           | unordered <br />array | ordered<br />array | binary<br />search tree | AVL tree       | hash table  |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| search    | $\theta(n)$           | $\theta(logn)$     | $\theta(logn)$          | $\theta(logn)$ | $\theta(n)$ |
| insertion | $\theta(1)$           | $\theta(n)$        | $\theta(logn)$          | $\theta(logn)$ | $\theta(n)$ |
| deletion  | $\theta(1)$           | $\theta(n)$        | $\theta(logn)$          | $\theta(logn)$ | $\theta(n)$ |

#### Answer:

see table

------

### Problem 8

Answer the following questions for the separate-chaining version of hashing.

1) Where would you insert keys if you knew that all the keys in the dictionary are distinct? Which dictionary operations, if any, would benefit from this modification?

2) We could keep keys of the same linked list sorted. Which of the dictionary operations would benefit from this modification? How could we take advantage of this if all the keys stored in the entire table need to be sorted?

#### Answer:

Optional
