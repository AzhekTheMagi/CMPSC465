# CMPSC 465 Assignment 6

## Name: Anthony Vallin		PSU Username: aav5195

## Format Requirement

- Algorithms in pseudo code **MUST** be placed in code blocks/fences (5%), and use either the `cpp` or `java` syntax highlighter. 


- Algorithms should follow the pseudo code standard described in handout 1. (2%)
- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. (5%)
- Formulas and equations should be in math mode using Latex math symbols. (5%)
  - Markdown math tutorial: http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf
  - Two ways to enter math mode:
    - Insert a pair of dollar signs: \$ your equations go here \$. This is the inline math mode.
    - Insert a pair of double-dollar signs: \$\$ your equations go here \$\$, which produces a standalone equation/formula set.

## Problem Set 

### Problem 1

Consider the problem of finding the distance between the two closest numbers in an array of n numbers. (The distance between two numbers `x `and `y` is computed as $|x - y|$.)

Design a presorting-based algorithm in **pseudo code** for solving this problem and determine its efficiency class.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm shortestDistance(A[0..n-1])
    //Computes shortest distance between the two closest numbers in an array
    //Input: Array of n numbers
    //Output: Distance between the two closest numbers
    Presort A[0..n-1] using mergesort or quicksort //mergesort(A[0..n-1]) or quicksort(A[0..n-1])
    min <- |A[0]-A[1]
    tmp <- 0
    for i <- 1 to A[0..n-1].size() do
        tmp <- |A[i] - A[i+1]|
        if tmp < min
            min <- tmp
    return min
    
```

Efficiency class: $ T(n) = mergesort + distance calculation = \theta(nlogn) + \theta(n) = \theta(nlogn) $

### Problem 2

Let $A = \{ a_1, . . . , a_n \}$ and $B = \{b_1, . . . , b_m\}$ be two sets of numbers. Consider the problem of finding their intersection, i.e., the set C of all the numbers that are in both A and B. 

Design a presorting-based algorithm in **pseudo code** for solving this problem and determine its efficiency class.

#### Answer:

Optional

------

### Problem 3

For the following list {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}, construct an AVL tree by inserting their elements successively, starting with the empty tree.

------

### Problem 4

True or false: The smallest and the largest keys in an AVL tree can always be found on either the last level or the next-to-last level? Justify your answer.

#### Answer:

False. AVL tree example on slide 3 in the notes shows an AVL tree where the largest key is not on the second to last or last level. 

------

### Problem 5

For a 2-3 tree containing real numbers, design an algorithm for computing the range (i.e., the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the tree) and determine its worst-case efficiency. You may describe the steps of this algorithm in **English**. 

#### Answer:

Algorithm Range:

step1: Find the key in the leftmost leaf for the minimum value.

step2: Find the key in the rightmost leaf for the maximum value.

step3: Return (maximum - minimum) value

Efficiency: $ T(n) = \theta(logn) $

------

### Problem 6

Outline an algorithm in **pseudo code** for checking whether an array H[1..n] is a heap and determine its time efficiency.

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm isHeap(A[1..n])
    //Determines whether array is heap
    //Input: Array with index 0 not used
    //Output: Boolean value true for array is a heap and false for array is not a heap.
    for i <- 1 to floor(n / 2) do
        if A[i] < A[2*i] || A[i] < A[2*i +1]
            return false
    return true
```

$  T(n) = \theta(n) $

------

### Problem 7

Indicate the time efficiency classes of the three main operations (i.e., FindMax, DeleteMax, and Insert) of the priority queue implemented as

1. an unsorted array
2. a sorted array
3. a binary search tree
4. an AVL tree
5. a heap

#### Answer:

| Data Structure     | FindMax          | DeleteMax        | Insert           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| unsorted array     | $ \theta(N) $    | $ \theta(N) $    | $ \theta(1) $    |
| sorted array       | $ \theta(1) $    | $ \theta(1) $    | $ \theta(N) $    |
| binary search tree | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ |
| AVL tree           | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ |
| heap               | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ | $ \theta(logn) $ |

### Problem 8

You are given a list of numbers for which you need to construct a **min**-heap. (A **min**-heap is a complete binary tree in which every key is less than or equal to the keys in its children.) How would you use an algorithm for constructing a **max**-heap (a heap as defined in Section 6.4) to construct a **min**-heap? You need to describe your algorithm in **pseudo code**. 

#### Answer:

```c++
Algorithm minHeap(A[1..n], min)
    //Constructs a min-heap
    //Input: Array with index 0 not used
    //Output: Min-heap array
    for i <- 1 to floor(n / 2) do
        if A[i] > A[2*i] 
            swap(A[i], A[2*i])
        else if A[i] > A[2*i +1]
            swap(A[i], A[2*i + 1])
            
```
